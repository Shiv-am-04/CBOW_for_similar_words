# CBOW

*The Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model is a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP) used to generate word embeddings. Word embeddings are numerical vector representations of words that capture their semantic and syntactic relationships with other words in a language.

*How CBOW Works:
*Context Prediction: CBOW predicts a target word based on its surrounding context words. For example, in the sentence “She is a great dancer,” if the target word is “great,” the context words would be “She,” “is,” “a,” and “dancer.”
*Network: It uses a neural network to learn these relationships. The model takes the context words as input and tries to predict the target word.
*Unsupervised Learning: CBOW is an unsupervised learning method, meaning it can learn from unlabeled data.

*We are using the CBOW to find the five most similar words.
